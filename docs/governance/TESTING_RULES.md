# TESTING_RULES.md — Quality and Self-Verification Rules

## 1. Purpose
This file defines how the project verifies itself so that business logic, RBAC, multi-tenant isolation, and product rules do not drift silently.

Testing is a required safety layer, not a polish step.

---

## 2. Testing philosophy
1. Critical business flows must be verifiable locally.
2. RBAC, tenant isolation, and security-sensitive logic require explicit tests.
3. The project must include contract tests that validate the existence of required rule files and key architectural folders.
4. When a bug or correction reveals risk, add a regression test whenever practical.
5. Fast feedback matters: lint, typecheck, unit, and integration checks must be runnable by default from the repository root.
6. CI must mirror the same primary verification command used locally so quality gates do not drift.

---

## 3. Required verification layers
### Static verification
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm run build`

### Unit tests
Test pure logic such as:
- permission helpers
- domain formatters/mappers
- lifecycle decisions
- validation helpers

### Integration tests
Test cross-file behavior such as:
- permission-aware navigation
- app shell rendering
- route guards
- feature contracts
- configuration behavior
- migration contracts for identity, recruiter approval, storage policies, and notification delivery workflow

### Contract and regression tests
Test the repo contract itself:
- required source-of-truth documents exist
- required architectural folders exist
- required CI workflow and deployment config files exist
- required PWA baseline files exist
- removed vulnerable dependency chains are not reintroduced
- critical rule changes are guarded

### E2E smoke tests
E2E coverage becomes mandatory as soon as auth, job application, and ATS flows are interactive.
These tests should prioritize mobile viewport coverage for the core hiring loop.

### Manual QA
Manual checks remain required for:
- installability
- offline states
- flaky network feedback
- touch targets
- mobile layouts

---

## 4. Mandatory scenarios to cover over time
- tenant isolation
- RBAC helpers and route/action guards
- auth user mirroring into `public.users`
- recruiter request approval and tenant bootstrap
- first platform owner bootstrap
- upload validation for file type, 5 MB size cap, and exact user-facing rejection copy
- candidate profile persistence, completeness updates, and CV storage access
- candidate visibility opt-in and recruiter talent search permission gates
- job lifecycle transitions
- application submission
- duplicate application policy
- pipeline stage transitions
- audit-sensitive actions
- operational error logging into Supabase for meaningful client failures
- user-facing error explanation quality for known platform failures, explicit uncertainty when the cause is not yet known, and admin error-state management
- notification delivery history and push subscription ownership rules
- storage access rules
- documentation/architecture contract integrity

---

## 5. Repository test organization
Use:

```text
src/test/               shared test setup
tests/unit/             pure logic and helper tests
tests/integration/      app shell, contracts, guards, module interactions
tests/e2e/              browser-level flows once introduced
src/features/*/tests/   feature-local tests when co-location helps
```

---

## 6. Rules for shipping changes
1. Every new module must ship with at least one automated check or a documented reason why it is temporarily blocked.
2. Every change to permissions, tenancy boundaries, security-sensitive workflows, or business invariants must add or update automated verification.
3. Database changes that introduce RLS, audit triggers, or notification logging must be verified against Supabase advisors and schema inspection at minimum until SQL regression tests are added.
4. Push notification changes must verify service worker behavior, RPC contracts, and the deployed Edge Function path when the environment is available.
5. File upload changes must verify allowed formats, internal optimization behavior where applicable, 5 MB rejection, and actionable error copy.
6. Error-handling changes must verify both the user-visible state and the Supabase logging path when feasible.
7. Failing tests block completion unless the user explicitly accepts a known failure.
8. If test coverage is intentionally deferred, document the gap in the same task.
9. Test names should describe business intent, not implementation trivia.
10. The `main` branch must stay gated by a successful CI quality run even when preview and production deploys are handled by a hosting platform.

---

## 7. Minimum command contract
The repository must keep these commands meaningful:
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm run test`
- `npm run test:unit`
- `npm run test:integration`
- `npm run test:contract`
- `npm run version:plan`
- `npm run verify`

---

## 8. Anti-regression rule
When a production bug, user correction, or architectural safeguard exposes a repeatable risk, add or update:
- an automated test when feasible
- `docs/governance/REGRESSION_RULES.md`
- any impacted source-of-truth document
