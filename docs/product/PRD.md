# PRD.md — Product Requirements Document

## 1. Product summary
A **multi-tenant ats and recruiting SaaS for approved ASI members** that allows:
- companies, ministries, projects, fields, and generic profiles to publish opportunities and manage applicants
- approved ASI members with active subscriptions to create reusable professional profiles, keep a preloaded CV, and apply quickly
- hiring, project, volunteer, and services teams to collaborate through an ATS-lite workflow
- platform admins to govern moderation, plans, and compliance foundations

The product should launch as an **MVP** and scale gradually toward a more complete recruiting ecosystem.

---

## 2. Product vision
Create a modern ASI member platform that replaces fragmented opportunity management via spreadsheets, WhatsApp, email, and generic job boards with one mobile-first, installable, role-aware system.

---

## 3. Problem statement
Many ASI companies, ministries, projects, and fields still manage recruiting or participation workflows with disconnected tools:
- opportunities posted manually in multiple places
- CVs arriving by email or chat
- no structured applicant pipeline
- poor collaboration and auditability
- weak candidate experience
- no reliable permissions model
- no good mobile-native workflow for staff or candidates

Candidates also face friction:
- repeated form filling
- inconsistent company processes
- weak application tracking
- poor mobile experiences
- unclear status updates

---

## 4. Target users
### Candidate / ASI member
Needs an approved account, active ASI membership, reusable profile, protected opportunity discovery, fast applications, and status tracking.

### Tenant owner
Needs to request validation for an ASI company, ministry, project, field, or generic profile, get operator access approved, and then configure workspace, team, roles, opportunities, and permissions.

### Recruiter / coordinator / hiring manager
Needs filtering, review, notes, ratings, and applicant stage movement across jobs, projects, volunteering, and professional services.

### Platform admin
Needs moderation, plan management, support tools, and governance.

### Platform support
Needs admin-console access to support tickets, operational errors, diagnostics, account assistance, and license activation without receiving full super administrator authority.

### Pastor
Needs a simple validated intake flow to prove pastoral identity, attach cedula evidence, declare union/association/district/church scope, and authorize normal professional users only inside that approved scope.

### Regional administrator
Needs a validated intake flow to prove administrative appointment, attach cedula plus official authorization evidence, declare union or association scope, and review pastors or normal professional users only inside that approved territory.

---

## 5. Jobs to be done
### Candidate JTBD
- When I find a relevant opportunity, I want to apply quickly using my existing profile and CV so I do not repeat information.
- When I manage my career, I want a reusable profile and status history so I can apply with confidence.

### Tenant operator JTBD
- When my company, ministry, project, field, or generic profile opens an opportunity, I want to publish it and receive structured applications so selection is organized.
- When my team evaluates applicants, I want permissions, notes, and stages so we can collaborate safely.

### Platform JTBD
- When multiple companies use the system, I need strong tenant isolation and moderation so the platform remains safe and scalable.

### FR-2.1 Pastor and regional administrator validation
Pastors and regional administrators must submit form-backed validation requests before receiving authorization duties. Pastor requests require cedula evidence, names, phone, district, association, and union. Regional administrator requests require cedula evidence, names, phone, official position, appointment evidence, and union or association scope. Approval must grant only scoped authorization permissions and must not activate product access licenses by itself.

### FR-6 Job publishing
Authorized tenant users must be able to create, publish, edit, close, and archive opportunities across jobs, projects, volunteering, and professional services.

Employment job creation and publishing must be limited to approved company tenants with the required tenant permissions. Professional individual users may view and apply to opportunities, but may not create or publish job postings.

### FR-9.1 Talent sourcing
Authorized tenant users must be able to search visible candidate profiles and open full candidate details outside the application workflow.

### FR-10 Pipeline movement
Authorized tenant users must be able to move applications across stages.
