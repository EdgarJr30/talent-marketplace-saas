# PRD.md — Product Requirements Document

## 1. Product summary
A **multi-tenant talent marketplace and recruiting SaaS** that allows:
- companies to publish jobs and manage applicants
- candidates to create reusable professional profiles, keep a preloaded CV, and apply quickly
- hiring teams to collaborate through an ATS-lite workflow
- platform admins to govern moderation, plans, and compliance foundations

The product should launch as an **MVP** and scale gradually toward a more complete recruiting ecosystem.

---

## 2. Product vision
Create a modern hiring platform for SMBs and mid-market companies that replaces fragmented hiring via spreadsheets, WhatsApp, email, and generic job boards with one mobile-first, installable, role-aware system.

---

## 3. Problem statement
Many companies still manage recruiting with disconnected tools:
- job ads posted manually in multiple places
- CVs arriving by email or chat
- no structured applicant pipeline
- poor collaboration and auditability
- weak candidate experience
- no reliable permissions model
- no good mobile-native workflow for staff or candidates

Candidates also face friction:
- repeated form filling
- inconsistent company processes
- weak application tracking
- poor mobile experiences
- unclear status updates

---

## 4. Target users
### Candidate
Needs a reusable profile, easy job discovery, fast applications, and status tracking.

### Employer tenant owner
Needs to request company validation, get recruiter access approved, and then configure workspace, team, roles, jobs, and permissions.

### Recruiter / hiring manager
Needs filtering, review, notes, ratings, and candidate stage movement.

### Platform admin
Needs moderation, plan management, support tools, and governance.

---

## 5. Jobs to be done
### Candidate JTBD
- When I find a relevant job, I want to apply quickly using my existing profile and CV so I do not repeat information.
- When I manage my career, I want a reusable profile and status history so I can apply with confidence.

### Employer JTBD
- When my company opens a position, I want to publish a job and receive structured applications so hiring is organized.
- When my team evaluates applicants, I want permissions, notes, and stages so we can collaborate safely.

### Platform JTBD
- When multiple companies use the system, I need strong tenant isolation and moderation so the platform remains safe and scalable.
