## Prioritization rules
1. Core hiring loop beats edge cases.
2. Security and isolation beat convenience.
3. Mobile UX beats desktop embellishment.
4. Reusable system patterns beat fast one-off implementations.
5. Documentation updates ship with logic changes.
6. Testing and security guardrails ship with structural changes.
