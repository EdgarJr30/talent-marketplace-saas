## 5. Domain invariants
1. A tenant-scoped entity must never exist without tenant ownership.
2. Employer-side access cannot exist without an approved recruiter request and an active membership.
3. An application must always belong to one job and one candidate profile.
4. An application must always have exactly one current stage.
5. Permission checks cannot rely on UI state alone.
6. File access must map to ownership and policy rules.
7. Role changes must be auditable.
8. User corrections to domain assumptions must update this model.
9. Notification channel attempts and row-level state mutations must be recoverable from audit history.
10. Candidate profile completeness should stay derivable from database state after row changes in profile sections or resumes.

---

## 6. Recommended enum groups
- tenant_status
- membership_status
- recruiter_request_status
- job_status
- workplace_type
- employment_type
- application_public_status
- moderation_status
- notification_type
- feature_scope_type
- permission_scope

---

## 7. Modeling notes
- Consider snapshotting selected candidate data at time of application when historical integrity matters.
- Keep candidate identity global while employer operations remain tenant-scoped.
- Keep recruiter conversion approval-driven: signup creates only a standard user, and approval bootstraps tenant + company + first owner membership.
- Separate public-facing application status from internal pipeline stage names if needed.
- Keep permissions granular enough to support custom roles without exploding complexity too early.
