# DOMAIN_MODEL.md — High-Level Domain Model

## 1. Domain overview
The product has four major domains:
1. **Identity & Access**
2. **Candidate Domain**
3. **Employer / Hiring Domain**
4. **Platform Operations Domain**

---

## 2. Core domains and entities

## 2.1 Identity & Access
### User
Global identity record.

### Tenant
ASI workspace context. A tenant may represent a company, ministry, project, field, or generic profile. Generic profiles are allowed because they may later convert into company tenants.

### Membership
Associates a user with a tenant.

### PlatformRole
Role for platform-wide administration.

### TenantRole
Role within a specific tenant.

### Permission
Atomic capability that guards actions or visibility.

### RolePermission
Join entity between role and permission.

### AuditLog
Tracks row-level changes, request metadata, and governance-sensitive events.

### RecruiterRequest
Approval request submitted by a standard user to become a tenant-side operator through a validated company, ministry, project, field, or generic profile.

### MembershipApproval
Administrative approval record or state that confirms the user may access protected ASI product content.

### ChurchTerritory
Canonical hierarchy used to scope pastor and regional administrator authority: union, association, district, and church.

### PastorAuthorityRequest
Evidence-backed request submitted by a user who needs pastor authorization capability. The request captures cedula evidence, legal names, phone, union, association, district, optional churches, reviewer decision, and resulting scoped authority.

### RegionalAdministratorAuthorityRequest
Evidence-backed request submitted by a user who needs union or association administrator capability. The request captures cedula evidence, legal names, phone, position title, appointment evidence, territory scope, reviewer decision, and resulting scoped authority.

Structured professional identity of a user acting as a candidate.
Current MVP shape:
- headline
- summary
- city_name
- country_code
- desired_role
- is_visible_to_recruiters
- visibility_updated_at
- completeness_score

### CandidateResume
Uploaded CV or resume file metadata.
Current MVP shape:
- storage_path
- filename
- mime_type
- file_size_bytes
- is_default
- uploaded_at

### CandidateExperience

## 2.3 Employer / Hiring Domain
### CompanyProfile
Tenant profile details. The current table name remains company-oriented, but the business meaning may cover an ASI company, ministry, project, field, or generic profile.

### JobPosting
Opportunity owned by a tenant. The opportunity may be an employment job, project, volunteer opening, or professional service need.

### JobScreeningQuestion
Question configured for a job.

### Application
Candidate application to an opportunity.

### ApplicationAnswer
Answer to job-specific screening questions.

### PipelineStage
Stage definition for a tenant or system template.

### ApplicationStageHistory
History of stage transitions.

### ApplicationNote
Internal note about an application.

### ApplicationRating
Evaluation/rating by hiring staff.

### HiringTeamMember
Can be represented through Membership + Role, but this concept is useful at the domain level.

---

## 2.4 Platform Operations Domain
### SubscriptionPlan
Plan definition.

### TenantSubscription
Tenant-to-plan assignment.

### FeatureFlag
Capability toggle.

### ModerationCase
Case record for risky content/entity.

### ModerationAction
Action taken during moderation.

### Notification
System notification record.

### NotificationPreference
User-level preference set for in-app, email, and push channels.

### PushSubscription

Launch-readiness notes:
- `memberships.status = invited` is a first-class MVP state used by employer invitations and invite revocation.
- `job_alerts.criteria_json` stores the current MVP discovery filters: query, workplace type, and country code.
- Email workflow notifications remain durable in `notification_deliveries` until the processor marks them `sent` or `failed` and writes `notification_delivery_logs`.
- `recruiter_requests.request_metadata` stores tenant-kind-specific onboarding data such as `operating_scope`, `sponsoring_entity`, `field_region`, and `conversion_intent`.

## 5. Domain invariants
1. A tenant-scoped entity must never exist without tenant ownership.
2. Tenant-side access cannot exist without an approved operator request and an active membership.
3. Protected product access cannot exist without approved user status, ASI membership, and active user subscription status.
4. An application must always belong to one opportunity and one candidate profile.
5. An application must always have exactly one current stage.
6. Permission checks cannot rely on UI state alone.
7. File access must map to ownership and policy rules.
8. Role changes must be auditable.
9. User corrections to domain assumptions must update this model.
10. Notification channel attempts and row-level state mutations must be recoverable from audit history.
11. Candidate profile completeness should stay derivable from database state after row changes in profile sections or resumes.
12. Pastor and regional administrator authority must be scoped to the approved church territory and must not grant access outside that scope.
13. Pastor/regional authorization and final license activation are separate domain events.

## 6. Recommended enum groups
- tenant_status
- tenant_kind: company, ministry, project, field, generic_profile
- membership_status
- asi_membership_status: none, pending, active, grace_period, expired, suspended, revoked
- user_approval_status: pending_review, needs_more_info, approved, rejected, suspended, revoked
- user_subscription_status: none, trialing, active, past_due, grace_period, cancelled, ended
- recruiter_request_status
- job_status
- opportunity_type: employment, project, volunteer, professional_service
- opportunity_compensation_type: salary, stipend, budget, unpaid, donation_based, not_disclosed
- workplace_type
- employment_type
- application_public_status legacy enum name for candidate-facing status
- moderation_status
- notification_type
- feature_scope_type
- permission_scope
- authority_request_status: pending_review, needs_more_info, approved, rejected, suspended, revoked
- authority_type: pastor, association_administrator, union_administrator
- admin_scope_type: union, association

---

## 7. Modeling notes
- Consider snapshotting selected candidate data at time of application when historical integrity matters.
- Keep candidate identity global while tenant operations remain tenant-scoped.
- Keep tenant operator conversion approval-driven: signup creates only a standard user request, user activation requires admin approval, and tenant approval bootstraps tenant + profile + first owner membership.
- Separate candidate-facing application status from internal pipeline stage names if needed.
- Keep permissions granular enough to support custom roles without exploding complexity too early.
- Do not model jobs or application statuses as public guest-facing surfaces until product policy explicitly reopens public access.
- Keep `job_postings` as the technical table for MVP while product copy and new fields model the broader opportunity concept.
