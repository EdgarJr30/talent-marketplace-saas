# ROLE_SCOPE_MODEL.md — Role and Scope Model

## 1. Purpose
This document defines the canonical role taxonomy, authority scope, and MVP permission expectations for ASI.

The product has three role layers:
- platform roles
- church-territory authorization roles
- tenant roles

These layers may overlap for one user, but they must not be collapsed into one generic admin concept.

---

## 2. Core role principles
1. RBAC is permission-driven; role names are presets, not shortcuts around permission checks.
2. License activation is a platform operation limited to super administrators and platform support.
3. Pastor and regional authorization is territorial and does not activate licenses.
4. Tenant ownership is separate from platform authority.
5. Professional individual users are not tenants and cannot create job postings.
6. Only company tenants may create employment job postings.
7. Tenant team members receive only the permissions assigned by the tenant owner/admin.
8. Every elevated authorization, license activation, role assignment, and permission change must be auditable.

---

## 3. Platform roles

### Super Administrator
Scope: full platform.

Purpose:
- owns the complete platform authority model
- can approve/reject any platform, church-territory, tenant, moderation, support, or licensing action
- can grant or revoke platform roles
- can activate user licenses

Baseline permissions:
- `platform_dashboard:read`
- `user:read`
- `user:update`
- `user:approve`
- `license:activate`
- `tenant:read`
- `tenant:suspend`
- `tenant:restore`
- `recruiter_request:read`
- `recruiter_request:review`
- `pastor_authority_request:read`
- `pastor_authority_request:review`
- `regional_authority_request:read`
- `regional_authority_request:review`
- `scoped_user_authorization:read`
- `scoped_user_authorization:review`
- `role:read`
- `role:create`
- `role:update`
- `role:delete`
- `role:assign`
- `moderation:read`
- `moderation:act`
- `support_ticket:read`
- `support_ticket:update`
- `app_error_log:read`
- `audit_log:read`
- `plan:read`
- `plan:update`
- `billing:read`
- `feature_flag:read`
- `feature_flag:update`

Must not be confused with:
- tenant owner
- pastor administrator
- regional administrator

### Platform Support
Scope: operational support surfaces across the platform.

Purpose:
- developers or support users who handle tickets, operational errors, diagnostics, and support workflows in the admin console
- can activate licenses when explicitly assigned this role
- can help resolve account access issues without becoming tenant owners

Baseline permissions:
- `platform_dashboard:read`
- `user:read`
- `user:update`
- `license:activate`
- `tenant:read`
- `support_ticket:read`
- `support_ticket:update`
- `app_error_log:read`
- `audit_log:read`
- `subscription:read`
- `billing:read`

Guardrails:
- does not grant super administrator authority
- should not grant role creation/deletion by default
- should not grant moderation actions unless support and trust are intentionally combined later
- should not bypass audit logging

### Platform Moderator
Status: recommended supporting role.

Purpose:
- reviews flagged users, tenants, opportunities, and abusive content
- keeps trust/safety work separate from support and licensing

Baseline permissions:
- `moderation:read`
- `moderation:act`
- `tenant:read`
- `user:read`
- `audit_log:read`

Why it is needed:
- support tickets and trust/safety decisions are different workflows
- moderation may need stronger policy controls than ordinary support

### Readonly Platform Auditor
Status: recommended supporting role.

Purpose:
- read-only operational review for leadership, compliance, QA, or external audit support

Baseline permissions:
- `platform_dashboard:read`
- `tenant:read`
- `user:read`
- `audit_log:read`
- `app_error_log:read`

Why it is needed:
- not everyone who needs visibility should be able to mutate data

- create job postings through this role alone

### Pastor Administrator
Scope: approved district and optional churches.

Purpose:
- validates and authorizes normal professional users in the pastor's approved district/church scope

Baseline permissions:
- `scoped_user_authorization:read` within district/church scope
- `scoped_user_authorization:review` within district/church scope

- `job:archive`

Baseline permissions:
- `workspace:read`

### Tenant Billing Contact
Status: future role.

Purpose:
- sees invoices, plan state, and billing status for a tenant without managing hiring or candidates

Why it may be needed later:
- billing contact is usually not the same person as hiring owner

MVP note:
- keep this future-only unless billing workflows require it.

## 6. Standard user roles

### Professional Individual User
Scope: own account and candidate profile.

Purpose:
- pays membership/licensing as an individual professional
- can view protected opportunities and apply with a reusable profile

May:
- manage own candidate profile and CVs
- view protected opportunities after approval, active membership, and active license
- save opportunities
- create job alerts
- apply to opportunities

May not:
- create job postings

- authorize other users

### Company User Without Tenant Ownership
Scope: assigned tenant membership.

Purpose:
- belongs to a company tenant but does not own the tenant
- receives only delegated tenant permissions

May:
- access workspace modules allowed by assigned tenant role
- perform hiring workflows only if granted tenant permissions

May not:
- manage roles or members unless explicitly granted
- activate licenses
- act outside the tenant

---

## 7. Tenant-kind rules for job creation
Only company tenants may create employment job postings.

Other tenant kinds may have future opportunity types, but they must not receive `job:create` or `job:publish` for employment jobs unless product policy explicitly changes.

Professional individual users are never allowed to create job postings merely because they pay membership or hold an approved professional profile.

---

- Pastor Administrator
- Tenant Owner
- Tenant Admin
- Opportunity Manager

## 10. Naming notes
Use customer-facing labels carefully:
- `Super Administrator` may appear only in internal admin surfaces.
- `Platform Support` is internal staff/support.
- `Regional Administrator` is the territory admin label.
- `Pastor Administrator` is the scoped pastoral authorization label.
- `Tenant Owner`, `Tenant Admin`, `Opportunity Manager`, and `Application Reviewer` are tenant-side operational labels.
- `Professional Individual User` is a product/account type, not a platform admin role.
