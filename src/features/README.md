# Feature Convention

Each feature folder should stay cohesive and may contain:

```text
components/
hooks/
pages/
services/
tests/
```

Keep business logic close to the owning domain and avoid leaking feature-specific concerns into global folders unless they are truly shared.

Experience note:
- route ownership and experience chrome live in `src/experiences/*`
- `src/features/*` should stay domain-first so the same business module can be reused by `storefront`, `candidate`, `workspace`, or `admin` when needed
